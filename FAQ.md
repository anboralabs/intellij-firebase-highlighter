## I am a student, can I get a license for free?

Sure! Please follow
[https://jetbrains.com/student/](https://jetbrains.com/student/) (students) instructions. If you are facing issues, please contact JetBrains
support directly. Unfortunately, I can do nothing, this is on the JetBrains
side.

Also, if you contributed to Firebase Rules Syntax Highlighter, please email me,
or send a private message on Twitter (dalgarins): I have some coupons for free
licenses for you.

## I received a coupon for a free license, how does it work?

Please note a coupon is not an activation code, it's a bit weird. You need to
hit the "Buy" button (monthly or yearly subscription, it doesn't matter), then
enter the coupon code. The form will now say you will get a 9-months license at
no cost. You can activate your coupons when you want, they have no expiration
date.

## Extra Notes

Firebase Rules Syntax Highlighter is still:

- free (MIT license). You can do what you want with it.
- partially gratis: you can get the sources, remove the code that asks for a
  JetBrains license, repackage the plugin, then install it in your IDE at no
  cost. This is legal, and this is why I will stick to the MIT license. You only
  have to pay if you want to install the plugin from the JetBrains marketplace.
